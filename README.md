# EZ-Flash Omega Kernel

This is the EZ Flash Omega Kernel, but with Spanish added to the languages list.

This is mostly based on [@elssbbboy](https://github.com/elssbbboy) work, but with
some little changes.

## Build

If you want to build this kernel for your EZ Flash cartridge, you need to install
DevKitPro. Follow the instructions from here:
https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman

Then just type `make` in your terminal and... voilÃ¡!

> **NOTE:** Don't forget to rename the output file to `ezkernel.bin`
